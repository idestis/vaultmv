# VAULTMV

**VAULTMV** is a simple go application which allows you to move or extend your vault path with ease. 

Probably once you created a path that was good at the moment. This path already contains a lot of sensitive data and the next day you faced the major issue, that you need to move all secrets for one level deeper to divide logical things. A manual copy of a huge JSON to the file and past it back is a regular method. But we are engineers, let's automate the routine.
